# Wordle Game Clone

In this modern era, English is must to learn for everybody and that's why we have to improve our Vocabulary so to do it we have to read Dictionaries.

But I know nowadays no one is ready to read it so we have a very wonderful Brain Storming Game called "WORDLE". So we can remember words very easily in a entertaining manner.

So Let's have a look to its functionality and working...

=> You have to start by guessing word of length 5.

=> In your guessed word if a character is present but in wrong index then it is showing Yellow Box and if it is in correct index then it will show Green Box.

=> Here, You have only 6 Guesses to predict a Word, if you predict before guesses ends the Congratulations to you! and if not then we will let you know about that word.

=> After Successful Guess or end of guesses, it will reload a page after 5 seconds and there is a new challenge for you to guess.
